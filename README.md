Some examples and tools how to work with UArrays and Data.Text in Haskell. To be applied for a Tokenizer in haskell project. UArray guarantee the higher efficiency oh haskell which is very important in Text analysis. In case it will be possible to combine the Haskell's (and may be Idris) type system with the high (?) efficiency of UArrays we may get a powerfull tool for NLP projects. 

Big part of the code I use is from: https://livebook.manning.com/book/get-programming-with-haskell/about-this-book/

Programm in Text/unicode_highlight.hs find and highlights a given text (quiry) in Sanskrit Unicode text file.
