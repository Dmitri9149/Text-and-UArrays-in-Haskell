Collection of examples and tools to work with UArrays and Data.Text in Haskell. To be applied for a Tokenizer in Haskell project. UArray's guarantee the higher efficiency with Haskell which is very important in Text analysis. In case it will be possible to combine the Haskell's (and may be Idris) rich type system with the high (?) efficiency of UArrays we may get a powerfull tool for NLP projects. 


I use some code from:  https://livebook.manning.com/book/get-programming-with-haskell/about-this-book/
